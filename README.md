### The codebase meets the general criteria for acceptance:
- When I desire to change the password criteria, then I am able to select which criteria to include in the password
- When I desire to change the length of the password, then I am able to choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- When I desire, I may choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- When my choices are finalized, then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- When desired criteria is selected, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- When the password is generated the password is written to the page
